Select your gear, roll the dice, move your car, negotiate the corners - win!

Instructions

1) choose a gear in the bottom-right corner

2) right-click your car forward one square at a time until all your moves are exhausted

3) go to step 1   :)

Rules
=====

Low gears go slow. High gears go fast.

You can move up one gear at a time.

You can move down one gear without penalty. You can move down more than one gear with penalty.

Aim to 'stop' your car on each corner according to the number of times indicated by the yellow flag. Your car is stopped when you exhaust your moves and need to choose a new gear.

Failing to stop the required number of times on each corner will result in tyre damage or crash.

Use the matrix at the top of the screen to see how many squares each gear may take you. The actual number will be a random number in the given range.

For the moment, every new game gives you a random gearbox with random ability.

The game presents a 'ghost' car if you play more than one game. The ghost reflects your personal best. Beat the ghost - beat your personal best.

Play the track as many times as you like and beat your personal best time.

DEV NOTES: the game does not end after the first lap (yet). Suggest you close the game and restart when you finish your first lap and try to beat your personal time.

Controls
========

Use left mouse button to select a gear.

Use right moust button to select a cell in front of the race car.
